# Useless Data Packs
 A lot of fun, but kinda Useless Data Packs


# Salmon Cannon
      It takes in salmon and puts out a salmon, with increaced velocity.
      What did you expect
      Try an iron or redstone block behind the cannon, it might fit your needs
      Does produce some free bonemeal, but not in a significant amount
      #X#   # = cobble
      #O#   O = bow
      ###   X = bucket
      
# Chess Pack
      Adds Chess Piece and a board to the game
      You can pull any piece out of the chest
      Click on the dye for a whole side
      Click on the Item Frame to clear the board - this will drop all pieces on the board
      If your world is laggy then placing the chest will spawn the board, deal with it
      ###   # = oak plank
      #X#   X = stick
      ###

 # Lava Collecter
     Adds a placeable block that collects lava from a cauldren above it
        Puts a bucket in the block, can be pulled with a hopper
     Wait this pack is actually Useful
     This makes dripstone lava sources completely automated
     Warning - this pack produces buckets for free -  âˆž Buckets
     
     #X#    # = cobble
     #O#    X = bucket
     #@#    O = copper ingot
            @ = iron block
            
 # Auto Crafter 1.1 - In Progress - kinda
     Adds a block that will take ingredents in and outputs the product
     Uses Hoppers to function
     Put the Final Product on top of the crafter to bind the crafter
         Break the crafter to un bind
     Example, 9 iron go in, 1 iron block goes out
     I did not make a RES pack for this so the block will look like a firework in inventories
     List of items are in file called "data auto carfter.txt"
     Binding a Gold Nugget will make Gold ingots out of Gold Nuggets
     
     #A#    # = Iron Block
     XOX    X = Diamond
     #X#    A = Gold Ingot
            O = Crafting Table
